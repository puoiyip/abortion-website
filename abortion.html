      <p>Everyone is entitled to their beliefs; that being said, it’s important to recognize that others may need access to abortion care for a variety of reasons, which is very difficult to achieve under the restrictive laws implemented in many states.</p>

      <h3>Medical Reasons</h3>
      <p>Medical reasons are a large factor in determining whether someone wants to terminate a pregnancy, especially since there are a number of complications that may arise, in which abortions or abortion-like services may be necessary. 
        <br><br>
        Miscarriages are a natural and spontaneous termination of a pregnancy, typically due to development issues with the embryo. They often require the same medication or treatment as abortion services do, which has become a challenge post-Dobbs in states where abortion is banned, as those medications become limited. 
        <br><br>
        Pre-existing conditions may also encourage some women to get abortions. For instance, heart disease or high blood pressure may be exacerbated by pregnancies, which may influence someone to get an abortion.

          <p id="fact1" style="display:none">According to a 2023 data analysis by KFF, of the 20 states with complete abortion bans or strict gestational limits, 12 states do not have exceptions for instances of rape or incest, and 13 states do not have exceptions for fatal anomolies. Moreover, the vague language of these laws make it difficult for medical practitioners to determine if someone is eligible for an exception.</p>

      <h3>Mental Health</h3>
      <p>Giving birth and taking care of a child can be very emotionally taxing, especially for someone who isn’t ready. As such, it’s important to give women the option to legally obtain an abortion. This will also give them an opportunity to focus on other important aspects of their lives, such as school and work. Moreover, instances of unintended pregnancies, rape, or incest can be very traumatizing for victims; terminating pregnancies associated with these events can play a significant role in their recovery.</p>

            <p id="fact2" style="display: none">Emergency contraception (EC) pills help prevent someone from getting pregnant, while abortions terminate a pregnancy. EC pills are not impacted by abortion bans, so everyone should be able to legally obtain them. </p>

      <h3>Financial Costs</h3>
      <p>Giving birth and raising a child can be very costly; some individuals may not have the resources to properly take care of another living being, especially single mothers. In the U.S., the average cost of childbirth with health insurance is $2,854. Without health insurance, women can expect to pay about $18,865 on average for childbirth.
